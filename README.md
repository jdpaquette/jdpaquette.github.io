## Welcome to My Blog (est Feb 1, 2025)

It is my plan for this "blog" to record my journey through learning as much programming types of languages as I can. I am currently a data anaylst so the plan is to start going through a Data Since track (Python, A.I. Machine Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Neural Networks, SQL, Power BI,  etc). 

I would also like to utilize my Python programming skills to venture into Web Development. Mainly a Back End Developer with Full Stack capabilities. This journey will likely include (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jdpaquette/jdpaquette.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
