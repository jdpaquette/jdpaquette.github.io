## Welcome to My Blog (est Feb 1, 2025)

It is my plan for this "blog" to record my journey as I learn as many programming languages as I can. I am currently a data anaylst so the plan is to start going through a Data Science track (Python, A.I. Machine Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Neural Networks, SQL, Power BI, etc). 

I would also like to utilize my Python programming skills to venture into Web Development. Mainly a Back End Developer with Full Stack capabilities. This journey will likely include (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms).  

### Tools

These are the tools I plan to use to accomplish my goals for this upcoming year. Not sure if I will or will not use all of these sources, but these are the beginning possibilities I have identified:

- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn) This is my favorite App for learning programming.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) This is my go-to for most training courses for anything, but especially programming.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) This is another great choice for free programming courses from Web Design to Data Science.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) This will be for Google Certifications and Data Science.
- [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/) Possibly utilize this site for Data Analytics / Science training.

### Day Two
Feb. 4th, 2025

Continuing with Colt Steeles Git & Github Bootcamp. I have now completed Section 3: Installation & Setup as well as Section 4: The Very Basics of Git: Adding & Committing.

Also continued with Python on SoloLearn completeing "Going Deeper with Python". As of day two on the Mercury League Leaderboard, I have earned 400 total xp placing me in a solid 2nd place in our group. Only one pro user ahead of me with almost double the xp. I really enjoy the gamification aspect of this App and the Leaderboard XP competition really makes me want to train longer to earn more. I think this will help me stick with the App longer and keep me focused. 

### Day One 
Feb. 3rd, 2025

This is the start of my training mission to learn as much programming as possible. I decided to start with an Udemy training course about Git and Github to gain some refresher knowledge on Version Control Systems and the use of repositories. Completed Section 1: Course Orientation and Section 2: Introducing Git.

I also started using SoloLearn to run through the Python programming language. Completed the first section "Getting Started with Python". Day one on SoloLearn Leaderboard placed me in the weekly Mercury League with 30 other random users. Only two other "pro" members besides myself. Currently 4th with 196 xp. Very simple with the use of text & numerical data along with variables...
