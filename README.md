## Welcome to My Training Blog

It is my plan for this "blog" to record my journey as I learn as many programming languages as I can. I am currently a data anaylst so the plan is to start going through a Data Science track (Python, A.I. Machine Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Neural Networks, SQL, Power BI, etc). 

I would also like to utilize my Python programming skills to venture into Web Development. Mainly a Back End Developer with Full Stack capabilities. This journey will likely include (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms).  

### Tools

These are the tools I plan to use to accomplish my goals for this upcoming year. Not sure if I will or will not use all of these sources, but these are the beginning possibilities I have identified:

- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn) This is my favorite App for learning programming.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) This is my go-to for most training courses for anything, but especially programming.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) This is another great choice for free programming courses from Web Design to Data Science.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) This will be for Google Certifications and Data Science.
- [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/) Possibly utilize this site for Data Analytics / Science training.

### Day Nine
Feb. 11th, 2025

Had a lot of meeting at the "day job" today. Also had a lot of grading to due in my two C++ programming courses I teach at University along with a hour long live session. With that said, I was still able to complete some sections in the SoloLearn app in the Python section. I am currently in day two of the Venus League with 265xp. 

### Day Eight
Feb. 10th, 2025

Completed the first week of SoloLearn and advanced to the "Venus" League with a solid rank of second place in the "Mercury" League. Completed "Working with Lists' as well as "Mixing Things Up: Loops and Lists" sections with another 165xp placing me currently in third place in the current league. I having been having some confusion with "break" and "continue" which I will need to practice a little more. Busy at the "day job" so not much else was completed.

### Day Seven
Feb 9th, 2025

Today I got back with a little more SoloLearn. I completed the "Control Flows" section and moved onto "Working with Lists". With only 16 hours left in this weeks "competition" at SolorLearn for my Mercury League, it looks like I will have to settle for second place. I currently have 817xp and the person in first place has a strong lead with 1162xp. Unless I get super motiviated, it doesn't look like I will be catching up. But at least I was able to participate in learning some Python at least a little for seven straight days.  

### Day Six
Feb. 8th, 2025

I spent the day in Hilton Head, SC for a little break with the wifey and having some moonlight dinner in Beaufort, SC at Q on the Bay. Stopped by Best Buy and decided to purchase a M4 Mac Mini (16gb / 512gb). The store didn't have the model I wanted in stock, so placed an order online with expected arrival on the 11th. 

I can't wait to upgrade from using my Intel i7 Macbook Pro from 2019. The M4 Mac Mini is appearing to be one of the fasted little pieces of tech even at it's cheap base price. All of my programming will resume using that platform and the MacOS system. I am slowing moving my tech "infrastructure" to the Apple platform and will mainly utilize my Windows PC for AAA gaming and for my day job as needed. 

### Day Five
Feb. 7th, 2025

A little more control flow from SoloLearn. Other than that I have been busy with my day job today. Did a little freeCodeCamp as well but not enough to warrent any comments today. 

### Day Four
Feb. 6th, 2025

Day four I found myself adding freeCodeCamp to my list of current courses to do in connection with the SoloLearn app and Colt's Udemy course stated previously. Since their website / course offering has been streamlined, I decided to begin again with "Responsive Web Design certification". Due to the fact that this is just HTML and CSS, I should be able to fly through the course pretty quickly so I can move onto the JavaScript course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures". Never hurts to get some refresher.

I also started another section in the Colt's course, Section 6: Working with Branches. I did not complete the section as of the end of this day. I think I was a little more focused on freeCodeCamp. I completed the next section in the SoloLearn Python course - "Control Flow" - Still currently in 2nd place with 665 xp and a four day streak. 

### Day Three
Feb. 5th, 2025

Only three days in and I am already starting to wander all over the place. While trying to stay focused on completing the course I started, I find my mind looking for other things to do and what I really want to start working on. Maybe I need some kind of Goal sheet or maybe a Trello board to keep me going forward. 

So, one this day I was a lot slower in my progress. I completed Section 5: Commits in Detail in the Git & Github Bootcamp and also completed one section on SoloLearn Python course "Working with Data". I now have 548xp and I am still in second place with my group. 

Am I trying to do too many things? I do not think so. I think my mind just gets a little board doing one thing, "area", for too long and wants to focus on something else. I typically am doing the Udemy course during the day and using the SoloLearn App at night. I might add a different course in to alternate days to work on two different subjects at the same time. This will allow me to move to something else when I loose focus while still progressing at a little slower pace in each course. 

Can you say -Pomodoro-

### Day Two
Feb. 4th, 2025

Continuing with Colt Steele's Git & Github Bootcamp. I have now completed Section 3: Installation & Setup as well as Section 4: The Very Basics of Git: Adding & Committing.

Also continued with Python on SoloLearn completeing "Going Deeper with Python". As of day two on the Mercury League Leaderboard, I have earned 400 total xp placing me in a solid secod place in our group. Only one pro user ahead of me with almost double the xp. I really enjoy the gamification aspect of this App and the Leaderboard XP competition really makes me want to train longer to earn more. I think this will help me stick with the App longer and keep me focused. 

### Day One 
Feb. 3rd, 2025

This is the start of my training mission to learn as much programming as possible. I decided to start with an Udemy training course about Git and Github to gain some refresher knowledge on Version Control Systems and the use of repositories. Completed Section 1: Course Orientation and Section 2: Introducing Git.

I also started using SoloLearn to run through the Python programming language. Completed the first section "Getting Started with Python". Day one on SoloLearn Leaderboard placed me in the weekly Mercury League with 30 other random users. Only two other "pro" members besides myself. Currently fourth with 196 xp. Very simple with the use of text & numerical data along with variables...
