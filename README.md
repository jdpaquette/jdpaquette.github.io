## Welcome to My Training Blog

It is my plan for this "blog" to record my journey as I learn as many programming languages as I can. I am currently a data anaylst so the plan is to start going through a Data Science track (Python, A.I. Machine Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Neural Networks, SQL, Power BI, etc). 

I would also like to utilize my Python programming skills to venture into Web Development. Mainly a Back End Developer with Full Stack capabilities. This journey will likely include (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms).  

### Tools

These are the tools I plan to use to accomplish my goals for this upcoming year. Not sure if I will or will not use all of these sources, but these are the beginning possibilities I have identified:

- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn) This is my favorite App for learning programming.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) This is my go-to for most training courses for anything, but especially programming.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) This is another great choice for free programming courses from Web Design to Data Science.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) This will be for Google Certifications and Data Science.
- [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/) Possibly utilize this site for Data Analytics / Science training.

### Day 13

Started the 100 Days of Python from Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This will give me something to follow along with and something to commit to for "at least" 100 days. This is a project based program that will teach you to program Python by completing tasks. Seems like a good idea to start off with. I will work through the program to get a good review of the system. 

Only completed a couple assignments on SoloLearn. Mostly just to keep my streak alive and currently still in second place with 542xp. 

#### Day 12

Went through Vs Code some more and downloaded some extensions for Python, Web Development, and C++ so it is ready for use whenever I get around to the bigger development skills. I also went through some more Git / Github training and messed around setting up some more repositories and pushing from local. Took some trial and error to get the "ssh" working correctly. Glad it is setup now though, so much easier to use then having to deal with username and password. Looking through Dr. Angela Yu's -- Web Development Bootcamp and her 100 days of Python Code. So between that and Colt's, not sure where I fit comfortably. I may just have to get out of the tutorials, but I feel like I am going to go through all of these tutorials to give a good review to my students and followers of which programs are good on these different platforms. 

In SoloLearn, I completed multiple sections. I finished "Functions", "Mixing Things Up: Using Functions", and "Collection Types". I finished the day with 522xp moving me into second place just behind the leader of this week's "Venus League". Keep up the good work :)   

#### Day 11

I finished setting up my new M4 Mac Mini with the programs I immediately need for both work, teaching, and learning. I downloaded and setup VS Code for Python. C++, and Web Development. I also downloaded, (in case need in future), PyCharm, CLion, and IntelliJ IDEA, and Davinci Resolve. I updated my Apple Terminal with "Oh My ZSH". 

As far as training goes, I completed 24 sections of "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" within the Responsive Web Design Certification course from @freeCodeCamp. I also did a little of SoloLearn finishing with 342xp and in fourth place currently. 

### Day 10

So, my M4 Mac Mini came in today from Best Buy. Between work, I spent most of the day getting it setup and add apps to it that I plan to use. Needed basically everything installed on the little guy. I need productivity apps, design app, and programming apps all installed. Deciding what I want to use this go around (MS vs Google vs Apple) and (Adobe vs Affinity vs ...) (Davinci vs Final Cut Pro) etc...

Oh yeah --- I also didn't do much programming at all. Just completed to exercises in SoloLearn Python to keep my streak going. Only at 292xp and fourth place. 

### Day Nine

Had a lot of meeting at the "day job" today. Also had a lot of grading to due in my two C++ programming courses I teach at University along with a hour long live session. With that said, I was still able to complete some sections in the SoloLearn app in the Python section. I am currently in day two of the Venus League with 265xp. 

### Day Eight

Completed the first week of SoloLearn and advanced to the "Venus" League with a solid rank of second place in the "Mercury" League. Completed "Working with Lists' as well as "Mixing Things Up: Loops and Lists" sections with another 165xp placing me currently in third place in the current league. I having been having some confusion with "break" and "continue" which I will need to practice a little more. Busy at the "day job" so not much else was completed.

### Day Seven

Today I got back with a little more SoloLearn. I completed the "Control Flows" section and moved onto "Working with Lists". With only 16 hours left in this weeks "competition" at SolorLearn for my Mercury League, it looks like I will have to settle for second place. I currently have 817xp and the person in first place has a strong lead with 1162xp. Unless I get super motiviated, it doesn't look like I will be catching up. But at least I was able to participate in learning some Python at least a little for seven straight days.  

### Day Six

I spent the day in Hilton Head, SC for a little break with the wifey and having some moonlight dinner in Beaufort, SC at Q on the Bay. Stopped by Best Buy and decided to purchase a M4 Mac Mini (16gb / 512gb). The store didn't have the model I wanted in stock, so placed an order online with expected arrival on the 11th. 

I can't wait to upgrade from using my Intel i7 Macbook Pro from 2019. The M4 Mac Mini is appearing to be one of the fasted little pieces of tech even at it's cheap base price. All of my programming will resume using that platform and the MacOS system. I am slowing moving my tech "infrastructure" to the Apple platform and will mainly utilize my Windows PC for AAA gaming and for my day job as needed. 

### Day Five

A little more control flow from SoloLearn. Other than that I have been busy with my day job today. Did a little freeCodeCamp as well but not enough to warrent any comments today. 

### Day Four

Day four I found myself adding freeCodeCamp to my list of current courses to do in connection with the SoloLearn app and Colt's Udemy course stated previously. Since their website / course offering has been streamlined, I decided to begin again with "Responsive Web Design certification". Due to the fact that this is just HTML and CSS, I should be able to fly through the course pretty quickly so I can move onto the JavaScript course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures". Never hurts to get some refresher.

I also started another section in the Colt's course, Section 6: Working with Branches. I did not complete the section as of the end of this day. I think I was a little more focused on freeCodeCamp. I completed the next section in the SoloLearn Python course - "Control Flow" - Still currently in 2nd place with 665 xp and a four day streak. 

### Day Three

Only three days in and I am already starting to wander all over the place. While trying to stay focused on completing the course I started, I find my mind looking for other things to do and what I really want to start working on. Maybe I need some kind of Goal sheet or maybe a Trello board to keep me going forward. 

So, one this day I was a lot slower in my progress. I completed Section 5: Commits in Detail in the Git & Github Bootcamp and also completed one section on SoloLearn Python course "Working with Data". I now have 548xp and I am still in second place with my group. 

Am I trying to do too many things? I do not think so. I think my mind just gets a little board doing one thing, "area", for too long and wants to focus on something else. I typically am doing the Udemy course during the day and using the SoloLearn App at night. I might add a different course in to alternate days to work on two different subjects at the same time. This will allow me to move to something else when I loose focus while still progressing at a little slower pace in each course. 

Can you say -Pomodoro-

### Day Two

Continuing with Colt Steele's Git & Github Bootcamp. I have now completed Section 3: Installation & Setup as well as Section 4: The Very Basics of Git: Adding & Committing.

Also continued with Python on SoloLearn completeing "Going Deeper with Python". As of day two on the Mercury League Leaderboard, I have earned 400 total xp placing me in a solid secod place in our group. Only one pro user ahead of me with almost double the xp. I really enjoy the gamification aspect of this App and the Leaderboard XP competition really makes me want to train longer to earn more. I think this will help me stick with the App longer and keep me focused. 

### Day One 

This is the start of my training mission to learn as much programming as possible. I decided to start with an Udemy training course about Git and Github to gain some refresher knowledge on Version Control Systems and the use of repositories. Completed Section 1: Course Orientation and Section 2: Introducing Git.

I also started using SoloLearn to run through the Python programming language. Completed the first section "Getting Started with Python". Day one on SoloLearn Leaderboard placed me in the weekly Mercury League with 30 other random users. Only two other "pro" members besides myself. Currently fourth with 196 xp. Very simple with the use of text & numerical data along with variables...
