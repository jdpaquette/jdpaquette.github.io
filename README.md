## Welcome to My Blog (est Feb 1, 2025)

It is my plan for this "blog" to record my journey as I learn as many programming languages as I can. I am currently a data anaylst so the plan is to start going through a Data Science track (Python, A.I. Machine Learning, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Neural Networks, SQL, Power BI, etc). 

I would also like to utilize my Python programming skills to venture into Web Development. Mainly a Back End Developer with Full Stack capabilities. This journey will likely include (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the MERN stack, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms).  

### Tools

These are the tools I plan to use to accomplish my goals for this upcoming year. Not sure if I will or will not use all of these sources, but these are the beginning possibilities I have identified:

- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn) This is my favorite App for learning programming.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) This is my go-to for most training courses for anything, but especially programming.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) This is another great choice for free programming courses from Web Design to Data Science.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) This will be for Google Certifications and Data Science.
- [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/) Possibly utilize this site for Data Analytics / Science training.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jdpaquette/jdpaquette.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
